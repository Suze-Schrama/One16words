READ ME for One16words application

# This application is designed to accept a plain text file and make word combinations per the users requirements. The user must provide a desired length for the combinations.
The application will then check if words of that lenght are contained within the file. If there are the application will use the other, shorter words to create the words of the target length.

I've included a jar file for your convenience. You can find it at .\One16words\target\One16words.jar.

## Instructions
Clone the project or download One16words.jar .
Go to the directory that contains One16words.jar .
Open the terminal and write the command java -jar One16words.jar .
Open your browser and go to localhost:8080 to use the application.
Close the terminal to terminate the application.
